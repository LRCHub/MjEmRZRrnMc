[00:00.59] Just the thought of another day
[00:03.55] How do we end up this way?
[00:06.04] What did we do wrong?
[00:10.13] God
[00:11.63] 
[00:27.08] Even though the days go on
[00:29.75] So far, so far away from
[00:33.06] It seems so close
[00:41.56] 
[00:38.78] Always weighing on my shoulder
[00:41.62] A time like no other
[00:44.62] It all changed on that day
[00:47.31] Sadness and so much pain
[00:59.31] 
[00:50.34] You can touch the sorrow here
[00:53.37] I don't know what to blame
[00:57.12] I just watch and watch again
[01:11.12] 
[01:02.02] Even though the days go on
[01:05.03] So far, so far away from
[01:08.01] It seems so close
[01:16.51] 
[01:13.77] Even though the days go on
[01:16.72] So far, so far away from
[01:19.74] It seems so close
[01:28.24] 
[01:26.34] What did it leave behind?
[01:29.38] What did it take from us and wash away?
[01:36.05] It may be long
[01:37.50] But with our hearts, start anew
[01:39.65] And keep it up and not give up
[01:42.39] With our heads held high
[01:54.39] 
[01:48.18] You have seen hell and made it back again
[01:51.98] How to forget?
[01:53.29] We can't forget
[01:54.30] The lives that were lost along the way
[02:13.30] 
[01:59.83] And then you realize that wherever you go
[02:03.68] There you are
[02:05.16] Time won't stop
[02:06.27] So, we keep moving on
[02:16.77] 
[02:11.22] Yesterday's night turns to light
[02:16.94] Tomorrow's night returns to light
[02:25.02] Be the light
[02:31.02] 
[02:50.57] Always weighing on my shoulder
[02:53.41] A time like no other
[02:56.26] It all changed on that day
[02:59.19] Sadness and so much pain
[03:11.19] 
[03:02.13] Anyone can close their eyes
[03:05.19] Pretend that nothing is wrong
[03:08.95] Open your eyes
[03:10.46] And look for light
[03:19.46] 
[03:14.52] What did it leave behind?
[03:17.58] What did it take from us and wash away?
[03:24.38] It may be long
[03:25.69] But with our hearts, start anew
[03:27.81] And keep it up and not give up
[03:30.71] With our heads held high
[03:42.71] 
[03:42.32] You have seen hell and made it back again
[03:45.10] How to forget?
[03:47.57] We can't forget
[03:48.63] The lives that were lost along the way
[04:07.63] 
[03:54.03] And then you realize that wherever you go
[03:57.86] There you are
[03:59.21] Time won't stop
[04:00.32] So, we keep moving on
[04:10.82] 
[04:05.44] Yesterday's night turns to light
[04:11.10] Tomorrow's night returns to light
[04:19.34] Be the light
[04:25.34] 
[04:34.03] Some days just pass by
[04:38.07] And some days are unforgettable
[04:42.11] We can't choose the reason why
[04:45.04] But we can choose what to do from the day after
[04:48.82] So with that hope, with that determination
[04:53.13] Let's make tomorrow a brighter and better day
[05:15.63] 
[04:58.12] Oh-oh, yeah, yeah
[05:04.04] Oh-oh and yeah
[05:10.08] And yeah, oh-oh
