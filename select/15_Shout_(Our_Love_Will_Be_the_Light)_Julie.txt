Will I ever know, will it ever show
It's you and me
Can we ever tell, all I know I've never felt this way
Everthing I've dreamed
Seemed so far away until this day
Now you're by my side and it feels so right

It may seem like all of this is kind of crazy
I don't know
Who knows what the future holds
- this I know for sure:

I wanna shout
I wanna tell the world that everything's allright
I wanna hold you, baby, close to me
All through the night
When it's dark our love will be the light

Will I ever know, will it ever show
Let's wait and see
It'll take some time
But I'm sure that we could be just fine
Are you the one for me, is that what they see
Is that a sign?
We can take it slow, give love some time

It may seem like all of this is kind of crazy
I don't know
But I think our love could be forever
Should've met you long ago

I wanna shout
I wanna tell the world that everything's allright
I wanna hold you, baby, close to me
All through the night
When it's dark our love will be the light

Ever since you came into my life
I've been feeling more alive
Now that I found that real love never dies
Could be you and I

I just hope that this time it's right
I wanna hold you all through the night
I just wish that this love is right
I wanna be with you day and night

I wanna shout
I wanna tell the world that everything's allright
I wanna hold you, baby, close to me
All through the night
When it's dark our love will be the light

I wanna shout
I wanna tell the world that everything's allright
I wanna hold you, baby, close to me
All through the night
When it's dark our love will be the light

I just hope that this time it's right
I wanna hold you all through the night
I just wish that this love is right
I wanna be with you day and night

When it's dark our love will be the light
