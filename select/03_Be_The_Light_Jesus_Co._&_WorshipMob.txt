Be the light, be the light
Be the light, be the light
Be the light, be the light
So darkness get out of my way
Be the light, be the light
Be the light, be the light
Be the light, be the light
So darkness get out of my way

Be the light, be the light
Be the light, be the light
Be the light, be the light
So darkness get out of my way
Be the light, be the light
Be the light, be the light
Be the light, be the light
So darkness get out of my way

You don't blame the darkness for being dark
But You call on the light to shine on it, so shine on it
Shine on it
Shine on it
Shine on it
Shine on it
Shine on it
So the whole world looks like Jesus

I am not a lamp under a basket
I am not the lamp under a basket
I am not the lamp under a basket
I will shine bright, I will shine bright

We are not the lamps under a basket
We are not the lamps under a basket
We are not the lamps under a basket
We will shine bright

Shine in the shadows (shine in the shadows)
You win every battle
Shine in the shadows, win every battle
Shine on it, shine on it
Shine on it, shine on it
Shine on it, shine on it

Let the light shine, open up the window
Let the light shine, open up the window
Let the light shine, open up the window
Let the light shine, open up the window (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, so darkness get out of my way)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So darkness, get out of my way
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So darkness, get out of my way
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So darkness, get out of my way
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So darkness, get out of my way
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So darkness, get out of my way
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So darkness, get out of my way
